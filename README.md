# Object-Oriented-Programming

My name is Nicholas Griggs. I am a student at Southwest Tech pursuing a certificate in software development.

This repository is a centralized location to keep my projects as well as make them accessible for others to see.

I'm originally from Texas but moved around a lot. I joined the Army when I was 18 and served 6 years. Afterwards I worked on cars for awhile before deciding it was time to switch course.

Ultimately this course is a stepping stone. The accreditation will allow me to use the certificate as well as completed courses at SUU to qualify for flight training.
